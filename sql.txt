MySQL is a database.
SQL is a Programming language.
MySQL(DB)<----SQL(Lang)<----Developer

Database - It is a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed.

Why Databases?
Can store large data
Features like security,scalability etc.
Easier to insert,update or delete data.

SQL(Structured Query Language)
Relational Database
(Data stored in Tables)
eg- MySQL,Oracle etc.

NoSQL
Non Relational Database
(data stored in document/key-val/graphs etc.)
eg- MongoDb,Neo4j etc.

create database name; (to create new database)
drop database name; (to delete a database)
use name; (to create tables)

create table table_name(
    column_name1 datatype constraint(rules),
    column_name2 datatype constraint,
    column_name3 datatype constraint,
)

insert into name of table (to insert value into table)
values
(
 values
)

select * from table_name; (to view the table)

DATABASE QUERIES

create database name;
create database if not exists name;

show databases;
use name; then show tables;

drop database name;
drop databse if exist name;


TABLE QUERIES

Create (create new table)
Insert (insert data)
Update (update data)
Alter (schema alter)
Truncate (table full empty)
Delete (delete full table )

Create Table

CREATE Table name (
    column name1 datatype constraint,
    column name2 datatype constraint,
);

Contraints
(rules for data in table)
NOT NULL - columns cannot have a null value
UNIQUE - all values in column are different 
DEFAULT - sets the default value of a column
CHECK - it can limit the values allowed in a column

e.g constraint age_name check(age >= 18 and city = "delhi")

CONSTRAINTS
PRIMARY KEY - makes a column unique and not null but used only for one.
there is only 1 pk and it should be not null.
    primary key (name of column)

FOREIGN KEY - prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
FK can have dupicate and null values.
there can be multiple FKs.   
    foreign key (table_id) references name of table(id)

Select Command
(selects and show data from db)

syntax - select col1,col2 from table_name;

(to show all) - select*from table_name;

UPDATE Command
(to update existing rows)

update table_name ----(syntax)
set col1 =val1,col2 = val2
where condition;

set sql_safe_updates = 0; (to avoid error)

DELETE Command
(to delete existing rows)

Delete from table_name
where conditon;

ALTER Command
(to change the schema)(column related)

ADD column
ALTER TABLE table_name
add column column_name datatype constraint;

DROP column
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP column column_name;

RENAME table
ALTER TABLE table_name
Rename TO new_table_name;




Where Clause
(to define some conditions)

Select col1,col2 from table_name
where conditions;

Operators
arithmetic operators : +,-,*,/,%
Comparison operators : =, !=, >, >=, <, <=
Logical operators : AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY
Bitwise operators : &(bitwise AND), |(bitwise OR) 

Limit Clause
(sets an upper limit on number of rows to be returned)

select col1,col2 from table_name
Limit number;

Order by Clause
ascending(ASD) or descending(DESC)
order by col_name asc; (syntax)

Aggregate Functions
(perform a calculation on a set of values,and return a single value.)
COUNT()
MAX()
MIN()
SUM()
AVG()

Group by Clause
groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
It collects data from multiple records and groups the result by one or more column.

select col1,col2, agg function(name of column)
from table_name
group by col_name; ---(syntax)

Having Clause
(applies some condition on rows)
(Having is for a group) (where is for the table)
grouping is necessary for Having

select col1,col2
from table_name
group by col_name
Having condition;

General ORDER

SELECT column
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column ASC;
